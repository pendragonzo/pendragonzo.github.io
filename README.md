Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a (relatively) normal person that does (relatively) normal things. I just don't like the internet knowing too much about me. Because it doesn't allow me to make mistakes that I can learn from without keeping them forever. Oh, and all that bit about using my data without my permission / paying me. I like open source stuff and would like to learn enough so I can contribute to projects I love and respect.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they / them
